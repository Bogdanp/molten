## Installation

    pip install molten


## Supporting the Project

If you use and love Molten and want to make sure it gets the love
and attention it deserves then you should consider supporting the
project.  There are three ways in which you can do this right now:

1. If you're a company that uses Molten in production then you can
   get a [Tidelift] subscription.  Doing so will give you an easy
   route to supporting both Molten and other open source projects
   that you depend on.
2. If you're an individual or a company that doesn't want to go
   through Tidelift then you can support the project via a recurring
   donation on [Liberapay].
3. If you're a company and neither option works for you and you would
   like to receive an invoice from me directly then email me at
   bogdan@defn.io and let's talk.
